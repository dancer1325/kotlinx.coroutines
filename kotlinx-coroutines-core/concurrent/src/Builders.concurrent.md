      * _Example of regular blocking code:_ `fun main()`

    ```
    suspend fun loadConfiguration() {
        // DO NOT DO THIS:
        val data = runBlocking { // <- redundant and blocks the thread, do not do that -> potential thread starvation issues
            fetchConfigurationData() // suspending function
        }
